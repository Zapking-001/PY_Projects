## 🛠️ Implementation & Environment
### ⚡ The Tri-Lens Protocol
- **[E] Efficient:** High-performance code optimized for $O(n)$ complexity.
- **[S] Shortest:** "Pythonic" one-liners and functional paradigms.
- **[M] Mathematical:** Code that strictly maps to formal $\LaTeX$ notations.

### 🐧 Environment Setup (WSL Optimized)
This project is engineered for **WSL users** with strict storage constraints:
1. **Clone:** `git clone https://github.com/Zapking-001/PY_Projects.git`
2. **Minimalism:** Zero external dependencies (No `pip install` required).
3. **Storage:** Total footprint kept under **5GB** via strict `.gitignore` of build artifacts.

## 🧠 Lessons Learned
- **Logic over Libraries:** Building core math logic without NumPy forces a deeper understanding of memory management.
- **Constraint-Driven Design:** Maintaining the 5GB WSL limit taught the importance of cleaning build caches and optimizing script size.
- **Precision Matters:** Handling floating-point errors in iterative methods requires disciplined rounding strategies.

## 🧪 Running Tests & Validation
To ensure the **Mathematical [M]** logic matches the **Efficient [E]** output, run the validation script:
```bash
python3 validate_all.py
```
*Note: This script performs cross-verification of outputs to ensure theorem-consistency.*
